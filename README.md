FP Haskell Center Configuration Project
=======================================

This is a special project which stores your IDE configuration.  Your
configuration is stored as a module called "Config".  Editing this file allows
you to customize the appearance and behavior of the IDE.

The [Fay](https://github.com/faylang/fay) compiler is used to compile this file
to javascript.  Once this javascript has been generated, it will be included with
the IDE whenever you load it.  It will not be loaded for this particular project,
though, because it is possible (although unlikely) to configure the IDE such that
it can no longer be used to edit the configuration.
